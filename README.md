2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Make sure all asset paths are correctly linked

##  What I Learned

- How to use `@font-face` for custom fonts
- Improved understanding of layout using Flexbox
- Better spacing and alignment with `gap`, `padding`, and `margin`
- Styling accessible elements and maintaining visual hierarchy

##  Future Enhancements
